We conducted an analysis on the data-set provided by Steve Laquitaine article.

The code snippet includes data visualization, data analysis, temporal dynamics analysis, and predictive modeling.

Data visualization: Plotting the sequence of prior runs for each subject.

Data analysis: Estimating translation lapses by calculating mean and standard deviation of errors in motion direction estimation for each subject.

Temporal dynamics analysis: Plotting the variance of choices over time and performing statistical tests.

Predictive modeling: Training a logistic regression model to predict choices based on motion coherence, motion direction, reaction time, and estimates degree. Evaluation of model accuracy on training and testing data.
